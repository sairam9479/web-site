<p>From an upscale cocktail lounge to a burger and fries dive, there are many different personalities your new restaurant or bar can assume. Defining your mission statement is an important way that you can attract the right customers and reinforce your goals, which can set you up for long-term success.</p>
<p>For us, sustainability is not a lofty idea but a fundamental, and necessary, endeavor. Our concept is about the food and drink of course, but it’s also about our team, our facilities, our practices, and the hundreds of decisions we make each day that affect the world around us. We believe it’s about finding a balance, which allows us to sustain our quest of making quality, accessible food, while also giving back to our community and the environment.</p>
